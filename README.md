First steps of Natural language procession project. 
The main idea is to analize linguistics and philosophical problems using nlp. 

As Wittgenstein stated in Philosophical Invastigations: 

“Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.” 

If this is true, and if we can state that all problems of philosophy are problems of language
then we should be able to at least analyse those problems using analysis of language. 
In order to do it let's use something more than classical linguistic or philosophical metods; let's use nlp.

It is something different to analysing philosophical problem and solving it, but it can be a good start. 
Also, let's be honest. We wont' solve or analyse all philosophical problems using nlp. 
For start, try with one, more recent than Vienna Circle's problems or Wittgensteinian one. 

Describing the problem

The following problem come from classical John Perry's paper "Thought Without Representation". 
Let's see the introduction to problem:

"I see a cup of coffee in front of me. I reach out, pick it up, and drink
from it. I must then have learned how far the cup was from me, and in
what direction, for it is the position of the cup relative to me, and not its
absolute position, that determines how I need to move my arm. But how
can this be? I am not in the field of vision: no component of my visual
experience is a perception of me. How then can this experience provide me
with information about how objects are related to me?"

"One might suppose that while no component of my perception is of me,
some component of the knowledge to which it gives rise must be. Perhaps
I am able to infer where the cup is from me, because I know how things
look, when they are a certain distance and direction from me. Without a
component standing for me, how could this knowledge guide my action, so
that it is suited to the distance the cup is from me?"

Now let's see Perry's conclusion, and jump to problem itself:

"There is a kind of self-knowledge, the most basic kind, that requires no concept or idea
of oneself. The purpose of the present paper, however, is not to argue directly
for this view, but to try to see how it could be so, by seeing how it is possible
to have information about something without having any “representation”
of that thing. I begin by studying something a bit more open to view, the
possibility of talking about something, without designating it"

The problem itself can be described as follows:

"It is a rainy Saturday morning in Palo Alto. I have plans for tennis. But
my younger son looks out the window and says, “It is raining.” I go back
to sleep. What my son said was true, because it was raining in Palo Alto. There
were all sorts of places where it was not raining: it does not just rain or
not, it rains in some places while not raining in others. In order to assign a
truth-value to my son’s statement, as I just did, I needed a place. But no
component of his statement stood for a place. 
The verb “raining” supplied he relation rains(t, p)—a dyadic relation between times and places, as we
have just noted. The tensed auxiliary “is” supplies a time, the time at which
the statement was made. “It” does not supply anything, but is just syntactic
filler. 1 So Palo Alto is a constituent of the content of my son’s remark, which
no component of his statement designated; it is an unarticulated constituent.
Where did it come from?"

In a simple words: How can I now what "it" means in "It is raining", when no component
of statement describes a place?

Natural language processing

In paper "Natural Language Processing: State of The Art, Current Trends and
Challenges" written by Diksha Khurana , Aditya Koli , Kiran Khatter and Sukhdev Singh we can read that:

"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a tract of Artificial Intelligence and Linguistics,
devoted to make computers understand the statements or words written in human languages.
Natural language processing came into existence to ease the user’s work and to satisfy the
wish to communicate with the computer in natural language. Since all the users may not be
well-versed in machine specific language, NLP caters those users who do not have enough
time to learn new languages or get perfection in it."

To do analysis we will use nltk Python library. 
See Nltk-introduction file to see current status of project. 

At first it will be mainly introduction to the topics, that we will use in future analysis.
